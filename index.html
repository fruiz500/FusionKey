    <h3>What is FusionKey?</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a1" class="helpItem">
    <p>FusionKey is the fusion of two apps: <em>PassLok</em> and <em>SynthPass</em> into a single interface, each app triggered intelligently by a single button depending on what's on the page. SynthPass fills password boxes, while PassLok encrypts and decrypts items. If you are reading this help page, this means you triggered the PassLok app, and therefore everything contained here will relate to encryption and decryption. You will see the name <strong><em>PassLok</em></strong> being used interchangeably with FusionKey to refer to the app.</p>
    <p>Before you do anything else, you may want to watch this three-minute video, which explains the essential concepts in a lighthearted way (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxgrES_CGcg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxgrES_CGcg</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>PassLok locks text and files, and sets up secure real time chat sessions using strong <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong>.</li>
      <li>PassLok is based on Keys and Locks. You encrypt something with <strong>someone else's Lock</strong>, so only that person can decrypt it with his/her Key.</li>
      <li>Your Master Key is a short piece of text, which <strong>can be anything you want so you can remember it</strong>.</li>
      <li>The matching Lock is then made from your Key and the email you entered. It is impossible to get the Key or your email from the Lock.</li>
      <li>You should never give your Key to anyone. Your Lock, however, is meant to be distributed freely, like a phone number.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This approach has a number of advantages over other privacy apps that you may be familiar with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PassLok does not involve a server separate from browser sync, and this is encrypted, so nobody can possibly have your private data.</li>
      <li>The same code runs on computers, phones, and tablets to make it perfectly portable.</li>
      <li>You can use PassLok with your favorite email, texting app, or any program.</li>
      <li>PassLok does not need to store anything secret. The only secret is your Key, which stays in your head.</li>
      <li>You can use PassLok with a public or borrowed device as easily and safely as with your private phone or computer.</li>
      <li>Several  Identities can coexist on the same computer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PassLok is <strong>still in experimental phase</strong> since there has not been enough time for security experts to uncover possible flaws. Bear this in mind before entrusting critical secrets to it.</p>
    <p>This version of PassLok is a Chrome/Firefox extension, and includes the SynthPass password synthesizer. There is a standalone PassLok Privacy extension that does not include SynthPass for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-privacy/epcchpdljafmfegifkigklfcmkphfmbh" target="_blank">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-privacy/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, and also as a web app at <a href="https://passlok.com/app" target="_blank">https://passlok.com/app</a>. If you find PassLok too difficult, you may want to try SeeOnce instead, from <a href="https://passlok.com/seeonce" target="_blank">https://passlok.com/seeonce</a>. <strong>SeeOnce</strong> implements the Read-once mode of PassLok plus one type of text hiding, but you never have to worry about maintaining a directory of Locks. Even easier is <strong>URSA</strong>, available at <a href="https://passlok.com/ursa" target="_blank">https://passlok.com/ursa</a>, which includes only the shared Key mode of PassLok. Finally, there's <strong>PassLok for Email</strong>, an extension for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-for-email/ehakihemolfjgbbfhkbjgahppbhecclh" target="_blank">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-for-email/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> that integrates with popular email clients (currently Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook). All of these apps are fully compatible with PassLok and FusionKey, although they are not necessarily compatible with each other.</p>

    <h3>Use FusionKey with email</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a17" class="helpItem">
    <p>To encrypt something:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure the email page's Compose or Reply box is visible and then, before typing anything in that box, click the FusionKey icon on the upper right of your browser.</li>
      <li>If you haven't used FusionKey for the last 5 minutes, you will be asked to select the Identity you want to use and type in its Master Key, then click <strong>OK</strong> or finish with Enter.</li>
      <li>On the Main tab, select the recipient(s) of your encrypted message, whose Locks or shared Keys you have already entered. With some exceptions, you will need to select "myself" as well if you want to be able to decrypt the message later.</li>
      <li>Write your message in the large box and click <strong>Encrypt</strong> when you are satisfied. After encryption, you may optionally disguise the encrypted text as normal text or inside an image.</li>
      <li>Click the blinking <strong>Send to page</strong> button to place the result in the email input, or the <strong>Copy</strong> button to put it into the clipboard.</li>
      <li>Write the recipients and a subject title and send the encrypted email normally.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>To decrypt and encrypted message:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If there are several encrypted messages, make sure the one you want to decrypt is the first one fully displayed on the page. If this is impossible, try making it the last one, or select it with the mouse (no need to copy it).</li>
      <li>Click the  FusionKey icon on the upper right of your browser. If you haven't used FusionKey for the last 5 minutes, you will be asked to select the Identity you want to use and type in its Master Key, then click <strong>OK</strong> or finish with Enter.</li>
      <li>Often the message will decrypt automatically and appear in the main box replacing the encrypted message, but sometimes you will be asked to identify the sender on the list in the middle of the window. Do so and click <strong>Decrypt</strong>.</li>
      <li>You can close the FusionKey popup by clicking back on the webpage.</li>
      <li>Remember that if you want to reply to the message you must click the Reply button on the email page before you open FusionKey again.</li>

      <p>If an encrypted message is disguised as regular text, you will need to select it before clicking the FusionKey icon. You may also need to extract the encrypted message from the text cover before you can decrypt it (this is explained in an Advanced Help item below).</p>
      <p>FusionKey is quite compatible with PassLok for Email, and fully so if Email mode is selected on the Options tab. It does feature a lighter integration with the email service than PassLok for Email (for instance, you need to identify recipients, which the other extension recognizes automatically), but this allows it to work with just about any webmail service rather than just Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook.</p>

    <h3>Invite others to FusionKey or PassLok</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a2" class="helpItem">
    <p>Before you can communicate with others using PassLok, they must have obtained the app, come up with a Master Key (which they won't tell you), generated a Lock from it, and sent it back to you.</p>
    <p>You can tell others about PassLok or FusionKey any way you want, but the app can help you to start your network with a single keystroke, this way:</p>
    <p>1. Type a message in the main box. Don't write anything sensitive, since <strong>invitation messages are not secure</strong>.</p>
    <p>2. Click the <strong>Invite</strong> button.</p>
    <p>3. After confirmation, the main box is filled with a formatted text with a short set of instructions plus the encryted message including yor personal Lock. Edit it as needed, then copy it to clipboard or click the blinking button to place it in the page.</p>
    <p>This is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTJWyd9s64" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTJWyd9s64</a></p>

      <p>People who did not get your email will still be able to obtain your Lock if you post it in the General Directory. To do this, click the <strong>myLock</strong> button if your Lock is not already displayed, then the small <strong>Edit</strong> button near the top, and then the large <strong>General Directory</strong> button. A new page will open where you only need to supply your email address, click <strong>Post</strong>, and reply to a confirmation email.</p>
      <p>Those who get PassLok from your invitation will have your Lock automatically stored in their directories, so they can encrypt items for you right away.</p>

    <h3>Get started with the PassLok side of FusionKey</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a4" class="helpItem">
    <p>When PassLok opened for the first time, it asked you to come up with a name for your Identity, then a Master Key, and then provide an email (or optional token). This allows you to have separate identities for different email services (which will have different email addresses). You can use the same Master Key for all of them, or use a different one for each. Master Keys can be anything you can type, so long as you can remember it.</p>
    <p>Once you are in the app, there is a button to switch to another Identity if you want. Identities go inactive after being idle for five minutes, after which you will have to supply the appropriate Master Key again.</p>
    <p>If you trigger the SynthPass side of the app while an Identity is active, it will use the same Master Key.</p>
    <p>After that, clicking the FusionKey icon on the upper right of your browser will trigger the PassLok app whenever one of these things happen on the current page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have selected some text (it is not necessary to copy it to clipboard). Then PassLok will try to decrypt this item (which might be concealed as regular text).</li>
      <li>Or there are no password inputs and there is a PassLok item delimited by tags, or simply it is a large chunk of random-looking text. If there are several such items, a dialog will ask you to select for decryption either the first or the last.</li>
      <li>Or there are no password inputs and there is a (sizable) box suitable for entering an encrypted item. If there are several, output will be placed in the last one of them.</li>

    <h3>How to make a strong Master Key</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a5" class="helpItem">
    <p>You should be able to <strong>remember your Master Key</strong> without having to write it down. FusionKey does not store the Master Key anywhere. In fact, it deletes it from memory after five minutes of not being used.</p>
    <p>As you type your Key, FusionKey displays a color-coded message telling you how strong it is. If you stop typing for a second, a mnemonic "Hashili" word based on your Key is displayed right under the strength score, to reassure you that you have typed the Key correctly, even if you cannot see it. Clicking the eye icon reveals the entire Key.</p>
    <p>Your Key will be stronger if it contains <strong>caPiTals</strong> in unusual places, <strong>numb3rs</strong>, and <strong>$ymbol$</strong>. If you use common words, <strong>miespell</strong> them to make harder a "dictionary attack." Break the words up with <strong>num334bers</strong> and <strong>sy#$%mbols</strong>. Avoid anything that might be easy to guess. PassLok knows frequently used words, but hackers' dictionaries are bigger. Do not use grammatically correct sentences, even if PassLok gives a big score.</p>
    <p>FusionKey <strong>compensates for weak Keys by adding spurious computations</strong> and may even appear to have crashed. If the app is slow, this may be because your Key strength is less than Medium.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbNM_cf8My0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbNM_cf8My0</a></p>

      <p>If you plan to use PassLok only with shared Keys, which your correspondents also know, you do not need a Master Key at all. Simply Cancel when you are asked for your Key when PassLok starts, and write or paste the encryption Key into the lower box that appears when you you click the <strong>Edit</strong> button located next to the directory.</p>
      <p>If instead of a short shared Key you paste in a piece or text at least five times as long as the message to be encrypted, PassLok uses it in Pad mode, which is theoretically much more secure than the regular mode (more on this in a help item below). You can also enter three pieces of text separated by tildes (~) to trigger Human mode, which can be decrypted without a computer.</p>

    <h3>Get a hint to remember my Master Key</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a6" class="helpItem">
    <p>If you are reading this, likely you have gained Guest access to PassLok by clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> at the Key entry screen. The good news is that you can still encrypt messages if you know the recipient's Lock or shared Key, verify signatures, and use the Locks stored in your local directory as well as all the auxiliary functions of PassLok. You can even seal items and display the matching Lock if you enter a Key when PassLok asks for it.</p>
    <p>The bad news is that  you cannot change anything stored in the local directory, and your use of it is limited to Locks. You cannot do anything that would involve your Master Key for that Identity, such as decrypting messages encrypted with your Lock, or continuing a Read-once conversation in course.</p>
    <p>Well, we've got even worse news for you: we cannot help you to recover your Master Key, because PassLok never stored it or sent it out. There are no saved hints, either. If you forgot your Master Key for a particular Identity, <strong>it's gone, along with all encrypted items for that Identity</strong>.</p>
    <p>But chances are you <em>almost</em> remember it, and are off by a few characters only. If you stop typing for a second, a mnemonic "Hashili" word derived from it appears right above it. Perhaps you can recognize the correct Hashili word when you see it, which will help you to reconstruct your Key. For your security, the Hashili word alone is not enough to reconstruct the Key.</p>

      <p>Hopefully Guest mode will let you get by until you remember your secret Key. But if you want to get full access to that Identity with a new Key, here are the steps:</p>
      <p>1. Go to the <strong>Options</strong> tab. Make sure the <strong>Advanced</strong> interface is selected.</p>
      <p>2. Click the Backup/Remove <strong>Options only</strong> box. When a popup asks for confirmation to delete your settings, click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
      <p>3. Reload FusionKey.</p>
      <p>4. The Identity selection screen will appear, and this time PassLok will accept whatever new Key and email or suchlike you want to give it for that Identity. Now you're back in business and can use PassLok with the new Key to seal, decrypt, store items in the local directory, etc.</p>
      <p>At this point, the only directory entry that will work fully is "myself". You can reset or delete the entries that don't work one by one, by typing each name in the directory Edit dialog and clicking <strong>Reset</strong> (leave essential data intact) or <strong>Delete</strong> (take out everything) when the name is recognized, or all at once by following the process described in a help item below, about "moving the entire local directory."</p>

    <h3>Use a different Key temporarily</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a7" class="helpItem">
    <p>For a given Identity, there is only one "Master Key" that unlocks all the capabilities of PassLok, but if you are willing to accept a limited access to its functions, you can use a different Key for the session, or whenever PassLok asks you for the Key. This way:</p>
    <p>1. Select the Identity and enter the new Key in the box (optional).</p>
    <p>2. Click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button.</p>
    <p>3. If asked for your email etc., enter it and click <strong>OK</strong>. (the <strong>Random</strong> button will write a new random value, different from the original random token, if any, so beware)</p>

    </div>
    <div id="b7" class="helpItem">
      <p>You can do pretty much everything, except things that would have involved the Master Key. You cannot modify anything in the local directory. When you reload PassLok and enter the correct Master Key, a warning will tell you that last session was run in Guest mode. If you don't select an Identity from the list, you won't have access to any stored Locks.</p>

    <h3>Make PassLok even more secure</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a8" class="helpItem">
    <p>When you first created an Identity, you were asked to optionally enter your email or similar public, easy to recall personal information. But if instead of entering your email you click the <strong>Random</strong> button next to the input box, an 43-character random token is used. This makes your Lock  much harder to crack.</p>
    <p>To back up your random token to a safe place in case of accidental deletion or to be able to use a different device:</p>
    <p>1. Click the Backup/Remove <strong>Options only</strong> button on the <strong>Options</strong> tab (visible in the Advanced interface). A backup item bracketed by "PL**bak" tags appears on the main box, from where you can save it to file, copy it, email it, etc.</p>
    <p>2. Then a dialog asks you if you want to reset your settings. If you click <strong>OK</strong>, PassLok will restart as if it had never started before, except that the local directory remains intact.</p>
    <p>To restore the random token from a backup item, paste the packup into the main box and click <strong>Decrypt</strong>.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DjhIjU_nuM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DjhIjU_nuM</a></p>

    </div>
    <div id="b8" class="helpItem">
      <p>The reason for the email or other additional data is to combat the "rainbow table" attack, where hackers pre-compute Locks made from the words in a dictionary. This data is encrypted and stored along with other settings, so you won't need to enter it again. The Lock depends both on the Key and the email or random token; this adds extra security, but it also means that if the random token gets erased you will not be able to decrypt anything that was encrypted with your Lock. The backup item contains your settings, including the random token, double-encrypted by your Master Key. One reason to delete your settings while leaving the local directory intact is to be able to change the random token to a new value. You can also proceed without entering any email or token.</p>
      <p>If you plan to use both FusionKey and PassLok for Email, it is best if you write your real email for this Identity in this box, for in this case your Lock will be identical to the one used in PassLok for Email and you'll be able to use their main features interchangeably. This precaution is not necessary if you use only one of these apps.</p>

      <p>By default, PassLok displays the Lock in Word format, consisting of 20 common words, so you can easily dictate it if necessary. On the <strong>Options</strong> tab, you can change this to ezLok format, consisting of 50 lowercase letters (except capital L) and numbers, or to base64 format like all other PassLok items, consisting of 43 numbers, letters (capital and smallcase) and special characters / or +<strong></strong>. The General Directory can take items only in ezLok and base64 formats. PassLok for Email is compatible with all Lock formats, but SeeOnce is compatible only with ezLoks. If you wrote your real email when asked about it in the initial wizard, rather than something else, then your Lock is the same as that used in PassLok for Email, and the encrypted items made by FusionKey and PassLok for Email can be decrypted in the other app. This precaution is not necessary for SeeOnce or the other versions of PassLok.</p>
      <p>If you need to make a Lock for a different Key (for instance, in order to receive hidden messages), it is best if you start PassLok in Guest mode by clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> when you are first asked for your Master Key, which will make PassLok accept a different Key. Then click <strong>myLock</strong> and supply the new Key and your email, if requested (if you use a random token you will need to copy it before, by clicking Change Email in Options).</p>

    <p>Now you can encrypt it, seal it, or split it just like a text-based message. You can also add more files if you want. The process to retrieve the original files is explained in the help item below.</p>

      <p>If you plan to send large files by email or other means, it is best to encrypt them with an archiving program such as 7zip, Winzip, or Winrar (Windows), Keka (OSX), or p7zip (Linux) using AES and a random symmetric key, and then use PassLok to encrypt that symmetric key for transmission, along with the encrypted files as attachments.</p>

      <p>It is highly recommended that you make a video whenever you change your Master Key, so that others can be assured that the matching Lock really belongs to you. When you post your Lock so that people can use it to encrypt messages for you, write the address of the video on the line immediately below the Lock, to facilitate the verifying process. Video URLs don't affect the function of Locks, so it is okay to handle the Lock and its video address as a unit. Obviously, you wouldn't do this for a shared Key, only for a Lock.</p>
      <p>Your PassLok ezLok is also used in PassLok for Email, so one video will suffice for both programs. PassLok for Email displays your ezLok at the beginning of any item you encrypt, separated from the encrypted message by a group of six slashes.</p>

      <p>PassLok does not guarantee the authenticity of the Locks posted on its General Directory. Email confirmation is required to post or update Locks, but this is not completely secure. Since users are encouraged to add authenticating videos and the General Directory has a button to play them, you should watch the video attached to a Lock before you use it.</p>
      <p>The General Directory is meant as a convenience, not as a replacement for your local directory. The General Directory is not available when you are offline (the local one is). You cannot post anything but Locks on the General Directory. Be aware that opening the General Directory involves contacting a server, which may lead to being tracked.</p>

    <p>Some advanced capabilities include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply a seal to a text, and verify its authenticity.</li>
      <li>Hide PassLok's random-looking output inside images or as apparently normal text.</li>

      <li>Change the user name, the Key, or the email/token.</li>
      <li>Backup or erase user settings, or even the entire local directory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is also <strong>Email</strong> mode, which displays only the functions that are available in PassLok for Email. In this mode, PassLok's output is nearly identical to that of PassLok for Email, so it can be decrypted in that program. The ouput of PassLok for Email can always be handled by FusionKey, no matter which interface mode is selected in Options.</p>
    <p>Finally, you can choose <strong>Compatible</strong> mode in Options (after selecting <strong>Advanced</strong>), which will cause PassLok's output to be accepted by URSA and SeeOnce.</p>

      <h3>Conceal a PassLok item (Lock, message, etc.) inside a piece of text <em>(advanced)</em></h3>
    </div>
    <div id="a42" class="helpItem">
      <p>1. Check that the item to be converted into fake text is on the <strong>Main</strong> tab. Then click the <strong>&#9660;</strong> button, if needed, to show the <strong>Text hide</strong> button.</p>
      <p>2. If you wish to use a cover text different from the default and you have stored it in the local directory, select it on the top box of the <strong>Main</strong> tab. Otherwise click the <strong>Edit</strong> button and enter the new cover text in the dialog, then return to the <strong>Main</strong> tab.</p>
      <p>3. Make sure the hiding mode you want is the one selected in the <strong>Options</strong> tab. There are five different modes: Invisible, Letters, Words, Spaces, and Sentences. Letters (default) encodes the item as identical-looking non-ASCII characters in the cover text. Words replaces each character by two words. Spaces encodes the characters into the spaces between words. Sentences encodes characters as grammatically correct sentences. Invisible mode encodes into invisible characters between two lines, which can then be completed to look like a normal message.</p>
      <p>4. If now you click the <strong>Text hide</strong> button, the PassLok item is converted into text, using words from the cover text. You may have to complete the last sentence manually.</p>
      <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7Fju1EwhV4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7Fju1EwhV4</a></p>

        <p>The recipient does not need to have the cover text in order to retrieve the original. The output of Spaces and Sentences encoding is roughly six times longer than that of Letters or Words encoding. The most grammatically-correct output is that or Letters and Spaces (identical to the cover text), followed by Sentences; Words output doesn't make much grammatical sense. Invisible encoding has no impact on intelligibility, but care must be taken to copy the entire invisible content. If the cover text is not long enough, it will be repeated several times. When you use Spaces or Letters encoding, you should be careful not to add or delete any spaces within the encoded text, but it is okay to add a few extra letters to complete the last sentence. Also be aware that some services replace the special characters in Letters- and Invisible-encoded items with something else, thus corrupting the items.</p>
        <p>Text encoding is no substitute for real encryption, and so PassLok will refuse to convert into text anything that does not look like genuine PassLok output.</p>
        <p>Cover texts do not have to be in English or even use Latin characters. Anything that can be written in UTF-16 encoded characters can be used (most languages, including Arabic and Chinese, will work fine).</p>
        <p>You can store often-used cover texts in your local directory so they can be loaded easily from the <strong>Main</strong> tab. To do this, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to the directory box, then paste the cover text in the lower box, and click <strong>Save</strong>. A popup will ask you to write a name for the stored cover text.</p>

      <h3>Combine a Key and a Lock <em>(advanced)</em></h3>
    </div>
    <div id="a55" class="helpItem">
      <p>This operation, which goes by the technical name of "Diffie-Hellman key exchange,"  is at the core of many PassLok functions. Should you ever want to compute the result manually, here is how to do it:</p>
      <p>1. Write or paste the Key or the Lock on the <strong>Main</strong> tab.</p>
      <p>2. Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button next to the directory box, and write or paste the other item in the dialog that appears.</p>
      <p>3. Click the <strong>Merge</strong> button. The Key and the Lock will merge and the 43-character result, which is itself a valid Lock, is placed in both the dialog and the <strong>Main</strong> tab.</p>
      <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EImhN35Tbs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EImhN35Tbs</a></p>

      <div id="b55" class="helpItem">
        <p>If both items or neither of them is a valid Lock, the merging process fails and a message is displayed. The result of combining your secret Key and someone's Lock is itself a Lock, which is the same as that of combining your Lock and that person's secret Key. You can combine a set of Keys into one by first making the Lock of one of them, and then combining the other Keys, one after the other, as described above. The order of entering the Keys does not matter.</p>

      <h3>Ask the participants in a Chat session to authenticate themselves <em>(advanced)</em></h3>
    </div>
    <div id="a56" class="helpItem">
      <p>1. Inside the chat session, type a bunch of garbage. You should expect the garbage back as a sealed item from each participant who has not yet done so.</p>
      <p>2. When a sealed item is posted in the chat session, select it and click the FusionKey logo, which will open the <strong>Main</strong> tab of PassLok with the item in it.</p>
      <p>3. In the local directory, select the Lock belonging to the person who posted the signature, and click the <strong>Unseal</strong> button.</p>
      <p>4. The original garbage string should be recovered, plus a message indicating that the sealer has been verified. If the seal is verified, this means that the one who posted it is indeed who he/she claims to be.</p>
      <p>This is all explained in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlEJJpF-Wmo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlEJJpF-Wmo</a></p>

        <p>This process assumes that the Locks in your local directory have been authenticated, perhaps by following the process explained elsewhere in the help area. When asking others to authenticate themselves, it is important to ensure that the text they are asked to seal could not have been predicted ahead of time.</p>
        <p>If there is no Lock for a participant, but rather a shared Key, he/she should instead encrypt the garbage text with that shared Key and post the result. Authentication will be complete once the encrypted text can be decrypted with the shared Key and the result matches the original.</p>

      <h3>Authenticate a Lock without using videos <em>(advanced)</em></h3>
    </div>
    <div id="a58" class="helpItem">
      <p>The easy way: call the Lock's owner and ask him/her to read a substantial portion of the Lock over the phone. But if you are communicating exclusively by email you can send a person whom you know and who knows you the following message, or something like it:</p>
      <p><br>
        <em>Dear So-and-So:</em><br>
        <em>I just obtained your PassLok Lock from (cite source), but I still wonder if it is authentic since I am unable to view the authenticating video. Therefore, I ask you to help me authenticate it through the interlock protocol. Here's what I want you to do:</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Write a message asking me to take a picture or video of myself doing something of your choice. Encrypt the message with my Lock, which is appended to this message, and copy it to a safe place. Then split it in two and send me the first half only.</em></li>
        <li><em>When I receive your first half, I will also write a message asking you to do something in a picture or short video. I'll encrypt that message with your Lock, and I'll send you half of the encrypted message first. When you get it, go ahead and send me the other half of your encrypted message.</em></li>
        <li><em>When I get your second half, I'll put the two halves together and decrypt your message. Then, following your instructions I'll send you the picture or video right away, decrypted, along with the second half of my encrypted request.</em></li>
        <li><em>When you get it, please verify that what I sent conforms to your instructions. If so, put together the two halves of my encrypted message to you, decrypt it, and send me what I ask in the message as soon as possible, decrypted as well. Then I'll know that your Lock is authentic.</em></li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Many thanks. Sincerely, This-and-That</em></p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can ask the other person to use PassLok's built-in <strong>Split/Join</strong> function, explained in another help item, rather than simply cutting messages in two.  The pictures or videos (or recordings) don't need to be encrypted. Only the instructions for making them need to be encrypted and transmitted with this two-step process. There is an article in the <a href="http://passlok.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/1/8/24187628/passlok_manual21.pdf" target="_blank">PassLok manual</a> that explains how this protocol works for authenticating Locks.</p>

    <h3>Check the authenticity of the code</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a59" class="helpItem">
    <p>If you got PassLok from an app store, that app store is ensuring that the code you have is what the author gave to them. The following is to check the integrity of the web app version of PassLok running in a browser:</p>
    <p>1. Direct your browser to "view source." If your browser has a command to save the source (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari do), go ahead and save it to file. Alternatively, you can go to Online-convert (https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator) and type the URL of your version of PassLok there, then skip step 2.</p>
    <p>2. Now you have to take the SHA256 checksum of the code (or the MD5 or SHA1 checksums) using a program different from PassLok. You have several options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a local program or online utility to take the checksum of the source saved to a file.</li>
      <li>Use an online utility where you paste the text on a box and click a button. You must make sure that pasting does not add extra space at the top or the bottom of the file, which would affect the result.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Look up the checksum for this version of PassLok, which is published on the PassLok information website at passlok.weebly.com and a number of other places. If this value and the one obtained above are not the same, the program has been tampered with. Here are some places where this information is published:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PassLok information page: <a href="https://passlok.weebly.com/get-passlok.html" target="_blank">https://passlok.weebly.com/get-passlok.html</a></li>
      <li>PR Gomez.com (author's blog): <a href="https://prgomez.com/current-version-of-passlok" target="_blank">https://prgomez.com/current-version-of-passlok/</a></li>
      <li>Chrome extension description: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-privacy/epcchpdljafmfegifkigklfcmkphfmbh" target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/passlok-privacy/epcchpdljafmfegifkigklfcmkphfmbh</a></li>
      <li>Firefox addon description: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-privacy/" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passlok-privacy/</a></li>
      <li>Android app description: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fruiz500.passlok" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fruiz500.passlok</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. Now, a hacker who could alter the source code at the server might also be able to change the published checksums so they match the tampered code. To make sure that the value is authentic you should watch the one-minute video where the author or PassLok, Francisco Ruiz, reads the SHA256 checksum aloud. A link to the video usually accompanies the published SHA256 value.</p>
    <p>This and more is explained in this video tutorial (warning: watching it may leak your IP number): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrAfSo2xjnY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrAfSo2xjnY</a></p>

    </div>
    <div id="b59" class="helpItem">
      <p>Typically, you load the source on a separate tab by typing CTRL-U (Windows) or option-cmd-u (OSX). Another way to save the source is to copy it by first selecting the the whole source code (CTRL-A or cmd-a), then copy to clipboard (CTRL-C or cmd-c), and then paste it into a text editor (CTRL-V or cmd-v), and save it from there. DO NOT save the code using the "save" command when the working PassLok page is displayed, since then the browser would modify the source code before saving it. The correct encoding is UTF-8, no BOM (notes: Windows Notepad is unable to save text in the correct format. Cut and paste from Chrome introduces artifacts for big items like the source code).</p>
      <p>SHA256 is built into the OS in Linux and OSX, not so in Windows, but there are free programs available, such as Checksum Utility and Bitser. There are also online utilities where you can upload a file and get the hash. Online-convert (https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator), fileformat.info (http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm) and freeformatter.com (https://www.freeformatter.com/sha256-generator.html) have worked well in our tests.</p>
      <p>If you want a clipboard-based SHA256 utility, the one at Xorbin (https://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) has worked quite well in our tests. Don't copy and paste from Chrome, since this introduces artifacts.</p>

    <p><strong>Data we collect:</strong> We do collect Locks, plus optional authenticating videos, and email addresses from people who freely upload them to the General Directory. This is meant for your convenience, since other people must have your Lock in order to encrypt items for you to decrypt. Locks are by their very nature not secret. Uploads are never automatic, but must be done manually by the user.</p>
    <p><strong>How we use this data:</strong> Locks in the General Directory are indexed by email and can be retrieved by anyone, even outside of PassLok. We make no other use of the Locks, videos, and emails collected in the General Directory, with one exception: every six months, an email is sent to the stored address, asking for confirmation to keep the Lock in the Directory; if no positive action is taken after two of these emails are sent, everything connected to that email address is deleted from the Directory. This is fully automated and involves no human intervention.</p>
    <p><strong>What data we share:</strong> Only Locks stored in the General Directory and their associated videos, if present, to anyone who searches for them by using the associated email, for as long as those Locks are active (expiration is six months). A special routine is set up to prevent anyone from collecting all or a large portion of the General Directory. Neither is it possible for a third party to retrieve a list of the stored email addresses.</p>
    <p>Concerning truly private data:</p>
    <p><strong>1. We cannot give your secret Key to anyone</strong> (not even yourself) because we don't have it. Your Key is never stored or transmitted, and by default gets deleted from memory  after five minutes of not being used.</p>
    <p><strong>2. We cannot give your private data to anyone</strong> because PassLok does not send anything out of your device. When you download the app from its server, you get only the code, without any cookies, plugins, or anything of that sort. We do store Locks that have been freely posted on our General Directory by their owners, as explained above, but those are public by nature.</p>
    <p><strong>3. We cannot eavesdrop on your chat sessions, or enable anyone to do so.</strong> Establishing a chat session does involve contacting a signaling server (Firebase) and giving it your IP address and a disposable chatroom name so that others can contact you; the signaling server never sees the content of your chat, which is between participants only. The PassLok server doesn't even see the connection data.</p>
    <p><strong>4. We will never weaken the cryptography methods contained within PassLok at the request of a third party, private or public.</strong> This also means no backdoors will ever be added. We would rather shut down PassLok than be forced to do this, which would betray the very essence of our efforts. If we learn that counterfeit versions of PassLok are circulating, whether placed by hackers or government agencies, we will make the fact known to users.</p>
    <p><strong>Notice:</strong> Since PassLok is distributed as a piece of human-readable code, we consider it an expression of free speech protected by the laws of many countries. Putting into circulation tampered versions of PassLok, whether by individuals or public entities, violates free speech and copyright protection laws.</p>
    <p>PassLok contains strong cryptographic methods, which may be illegal to use in some countries. Please check the local laws before using PassLok.</p>

    <p>This paragraph and the canary logo above attest to the fact that, up until the release of version 0.1.3 (December 2019) we have not received any requests under gag order for user data or modifications of the code. This paragraph will be periodically updated as this situation continues.</p>

    <p>You will get better security if you also provide some public piece of data about yourself, such as your email address. There's no risk of spam since nothing will be sent out. You can skip this if you want.</p>

    <p>When you click the button below, the random-looking Lock matching your secret Key will appear on PassLok's Main screen, along with some further instructions. You want to send that Lock to your friends so they can send you encrypted messages. It will also be sent if you make an Invitation message by checking the box below, or switch to Email mode in Options.</p>
    <p>You will start in Basic mode, which shows only the most essential functions. If you are looking for more features, go to the Options tab and check the Advanced checkbox. There is also Email mode, which makes this app fully compatible with <em>PassLok for Email</em>.</p>

    <h3>What is FusionKey?</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c1" class="helpItem">
    <p>FusionKey is the fusion of two apps: <em>PassLok</em> and <em>SynthPass</em> into a single interface, each app triggered intelligently by a single button depending on what's on the page. SynthPass fills password boxes, while PassLok encrypts and decrypts items. If you are reading this help page, this means you triggered the SynthPass app, and therefore everything contained here will relate to filling passwords. You will see the name <strong><em>SynthPass</em></strong> being used interchangeably with FusionKey to refer to the app.</p>
    <p>SynthPass is a password manager of a different kind: rather than storing your passwords, <em>it synthesizes them on the fly</em> based on your Master Key, which stays always the same. This way, there is no need to store anything secret that might be compromised, and you don't have to keep paying someone to store passwords for you. SynthPass-made passwords are high-strength, and different for each website.</p>
    <p>You can keep reusing your Master Key even if a particular website forces you to change its password. Simply add a serial (numbers, letters, it doesn't matter what), and you're set. SynthPass will remember the serial for you, as well as your user ID if you enter it. The only thing you need to remember is your Master Key, which you will never have to change if you don't want to.</p>
    <p>If you absolutely must use a non-random password, FusionKey can also remember it for you. It gets encrypted and syncs with the browser, so you don't have to worry about third parties having access to it.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="cc2" class="helpHeading">
    <h3>Do this first</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c2" class="helpItem">
    <p>The first thing to do is change your password for a given website to a SynthPass-made password. There is more complete help on this down below, but this is the summary of what you need to do:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to the page where you change the password for that particular website. Typically, it will contain a box to write the current password, and one or two more to type in the new password. Notice if there is a restriction on length or special characters.</li>
      <li>Click the FusionKey logo (or use the shortcut ctrl-shift-K in Windows, Linux, or ChromeOS, or cmd-shift-K in MacOS), which will open a dialog containing as many rows as password boxes on the page. Type your Master Key in the first box labeled as such. If there is a length restriction, type the number into the <em>length</em> box. If you want certain special characters to be used, type them into the <em>length</em> box too. Then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
      <li>All the password boxes on the page are now filled with your new password. Go to the box for the old password, delete what is there, and type your old password. Then save the changes by clicking the appropriate button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After this, the website will accept your SynthPass-made password in place of the old one. If you have a password manager that offers to remember your new password, there is no harm doing that, but you won't need it anymore.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the button to accept the new passwords won't work. Just click inside the password boxes, type in a character (doesn't matther what) and delete it immediately. This should re-enable the button.</p>

    <h3>How do I fill a Password?</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c3" class="helpItem">
    <p>When a password field is visible on a webpage, do this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the FusionKey logo.</li>
      <li>A popup box will appear, containing writable boxes for your Master Key and an optional serial, plus the user ID if there is a single extra box on the webpage, and the password length (default is 44). The serial box will be filled already if you used a serial on this website before, as well as the user ID and the length etc.. If you have used your Master Key within the last five minutes, this box will be filled also. To make a PIN consisting only of digits, type 'pin' in the <em>length</em> box (default is 4 digits), or 'pin6' (6 digits) and so forth.</li>
      <li>Type in your Master Key if needed. As you type, its strength and entropy are displayed near the top of the dialog. If you stop typing for a second, a mnemonic "Hashili" word is displayed in the message area to reassure you that your typed it correctly. Clicking the eye icon reveals the complete password. When you are satisfied, click <strong>OK</strong> or press the <strong>Enter</strong> key.</li>
      <li>When the popup disappears, the password and user ID fields on the webpage will be filled, but login has not yet taken place. Proceed from this point on as if you had typed in user ID and password directly into the webpage. Sometimes a website requires that you physically type something in the password box; in this case it is enough to click in the middle of the password (which you won't see), type a character, and then immediately press the Delete or Backspace key to remove it.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the popup says that it cannot see the password field or displays more than one box for the Master Key, you may need to paste in the synthesized password manually. The process for this is explained two Help items below this one.</p>
    <p>The PassLok interface will appear instead of the SynthPass interface if a portion of the page has been selected.</p>
    <p>There is a 3-minute video on YouTube explaining all of this with examples: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLGScvETOEc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLGScvETOEc</a></p>

    <h3>How do I change a Password?</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c4" class="helpItem">
    <p>When you reach a password change webpage, clicking the FusionKey logo will open a popup containing several rows, one for each password field on the page, arranged in the same order, plus a box for password length. This is what you do next:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Type in your Master Key in the first box  corresponding to the old password, if it was made by SynthPass. Type the old serial, which should appear on the first row, into the boxes next to them. Add the user ID and other options if the boxes are not populated already. Default length is 44, and the password is composed of capitals and smallcase letters, numbers, and the characters !#_  If you omit typing in a password or serial box, SynthPass will use the value in the box above it.</li>
      <li>To use what you type in the password box as-is, without any synthesis, and without storing it (like when you are going to use a SynthPass-made password for the first time), type a minus sign ( - ) in the serial box to its right. To use something else, which will be stored, write your Master Key in its box, and a plus sign (+) in the serial box. A popup will ask you for the new password, which will be remembered.</li>
      <li>Do the same for the box or boxes corresponding to the new password. Typically this will involve simply a new serial, and in this case it is enought to type it in the corresponding box or boxes. Again, if a box is left empty, the value above it will be used. To revert to not using a serial, type a space in that serial field. You can change your Master Key at this point, by typing in a new one.</li>
      <li>To make SynthPass remember the new serial, click on it or the password box to its left to make sure it is highlighted before clicking OK. Then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
      <li>When the popup disappears, all the password fields, new and old, will be filled. Proceed from this point onward as if you had filled them manually.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Something is not working, but I still want to synthesize a Password</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c5" class="helpItem">
  	<p>Sometimes websites change their own web address without warning, which will change the password that SynthPass makes for it. Other times the website won't accept the password until you have physically typed something into that box. Just click on the filled password, type any character somewhere inside, then delete it immediately.</p>
    <p>And sometimes you encounter websites that just don't want to cooperate. This is why we have the little dialog below, which works exactly like the popup to synthesize a single password, and displays the result so you can edit it, copy it, and paste it manually. Since this help page is no longer connected to the website you want to log into, there is an extra box to enter the website name (just the last two words, as in "synthpass.com", case insensitive), which the popup would have taken directly from the website. You also need to supply the serial, if any, and the length or special characters to include if different from the !#_ set. None of this data will be remembered. This dialog cannot retrieve stored passwords, only synthesize new ones.</p>
    <p>For your protection, the input fields will be cleared after the password is synthesized, and the output field when it is copied to clipboard.</p>

    <h3>FusionKey says my Master Key is Terrible</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c6" class="helpItem">
    <p>This is probably because it has a very low entropy, which means it is very easy to guess. Hackers are going to crack your Master Key by trying combinations of words, possibly with obvious character substitutions such as 0 instead of o. SynthPass contains a sophisticated password-scoring algorithm that awards points for each word and each letter or character. If a word is on its blacklist of 10,000 most used passwords, it gets no points.</p>
    <p>SynthPass compensates for low entropy by adding extra computations, so that even known bad passwords are still allowed. Execution will be slow, however, unless your Master Key gets at least a Medium score.</p>
    <p>So do yourself a favor and experiment a bit until you come up with a Master Key that scores high and is still easy to remember. Once you find it, you won't have to change it again.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="cc7" class="helpHeading">
    <h3>What's that nonsense word that appears when I stop typing?</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c7" class="helpItem">
    <p>This is a digital fingerprint of your Master Key, displayed as an 4-letter word. We call it "Hashili" because it comes from a "hash" and often sounds rather African. The point of Hashili is to reassure you that you have typed your Master Key correctly without having to make it visible. Likely you won't quite remember the Hashili for your Key, but you'll know it's correct when you see it because just one little mistake changes the word completely. Think of it as SynthPass saying "correct!" in its own exotic language.</p>
    <p>If you still aren't quite sure that what you typed is correct, clicking the eye icon reveals the full contents of the Master Key box.</p>
    <p>There are ten thousand different Hashili words but many, many more possibilities for your Master Key. This means that nobody can retrieve your Key even if they get its Hashili.</p>

    <h3>I can't remember my Master Key</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c8" class="helpItem">
    <p>Then you won't be able to generate passwords for any websites. Sorry. Neither the Master Key nor the synthesized website passwords are stored anywhere. User-supplied website passwords are stored, but they cannot be decrypted without the Master Key.</p>
    <p>Here's where Hashili comes in handy. It is likely that you mistyped your Master Key or it's missing something. Try varying what you type as you look at its Hashili fingerprint. Hashili is hard to remember, but easy to recognize once you get the right one.</p>
    <p>If all else fails, most websites have a link to reset your password after verifying your email address. Next time make sure you use a Master Key that you can actually remember. High entropy is nice, but the app will take a low entropy password just as well.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="cc9" class="helpHeading">
    <h3>Where are the options?</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c9" class="helpItem">
    <p>SynthPass does not have general options, but sometimes a website only allows passwords of a certain length or composition. To take care of this, you can enter some additional data in the <strong>Length</strong> box, which will be remembered next time you load that website. These can be entered in any order:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>To limit the length to a certain value, enter the numeric value in the box (as in 20, or 15)    
    <li>To output only numbers, enter "num" or "pin" without the quotes (or any word that contains those strings, such as "number"); default length is 4
    <li>To force alphanumeric output, without any special characters, enter "al" without the quotes (or any word that contains that string, such as "alpha"); default length is 44
    <li>To use certain special characters instead of the default !#_ set, enter them in the box; default length is 44, with the first character in the set appearing at the beginning
    </ul>
    <p>For example, entering "30 numbers" (again, no quotes) in the Length box, causes the generated password to contain 30 numerical digits, and no letters or special characters. If you enter "@$%*&amp;" (no quotes) the generated password will be the default 44 characters long and will be composed of letters (smallcase and capitals), numbers, and those special characters, and no other symbols. If you write "alphabetic 25" (no quotes), the generated password will contain a total of 25 letters (small and capitals) and numbers, with no special characters.</p>

  <div id="c10" class="helpItem">
    <p>At the moment SynthPass is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox, and the only mobile browser that supports extensions is Firefox on Android. But you are not stuck being unable to log into that critical website just because of this. We have made a webpage that will synthesize the same password if you just provide the website name, any special options, the serial if any, and of course your Master Key. You can save it to Home Page and run it offline if you like. Here's the address:</p>
    <p><a href="https://synthpass.com/app" target="_blank">https://synthpass.com/app</a></p>
    <p>This is also explained, among other things, in this YouTube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5jwImGkzCc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5jwImGkzCc</a></p>

    <h3>I want to learn more about SynthPass</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c11" class="helpItem">
  <p>Here are more technical details. SynthPass generates 256-bit passwords that are converted to base64, so we end up with 44 alphanumeric characters. Some of those are later converted to other characters that are typically accepted in passwords, in order to satisfy common password requirements. The 256-bit passwords are the result of running a variable number of SCRYPT iterations on the Master Key, with the website name and serial appended to it. The SCRYPT implementation used is the one by D. Chestnykh, which is in turn based on the NaCl crypto library. The number of SCRYPT iterations is a function of the entropy of the Master Key, which is measured with an algorithm by F. Ruiz called WiseHash. This algorithm is also used in PassLok, RSA, SeeOnce, and other crypto programs by F. Ruiz.</p>
  <p>Unlike in other algorithms, "bad" passwords having a low entropy are allowed. This forces those trying to guess a user's Master Key to perform a lot of computations on the "bad" passwords before they can move on to those having a higher entropy, or risk missing the "easy" ones.</p>
  <p>We have a nifty info page at <a href="https://synthpass.com" target="_blank">https://synthpass.com</a> with links to all versions of SynthPass, information material, and tutorials.</p>
   <p>SynthPass is open source, so you can always get the latest development version from its Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/fruiz500/synthpass" target="_blank">https://github.com/fruiz500/synthpass</a>. You can also contribute to its development if you feel so inclined. If you wish to report a bug or request a feature, this is the right place to do it. Just start a new Issue.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Statement and Warrant Canary</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c12" class="helpItem">
    <p>SynthPass requests access to all website content in order to detect password input fields and fill them for you, but that is the extent of its involvement with your data, because it is a self-contained piece of code that does not rely on servers to do its job. Neither the Master Password nor the synthesized passwords made by the app are ever stored, even locally. User-supplied passwords are stored locally and in browser sync, but encrypted. Therefore:</p>
    <p><strong>1. We cannot give your Master Key or any of your synthesized or stored passwords to anyone</strong> (not even yourself) because we don't have them.</p>
    <p><strong>2. We cannot give your private data to anyone</strong> because the app does not send anything to us. When you download the app from the extension store, you get only the code, without any cookies, plugins, or anything of that sort.</p>
    <p><strong>4. We will never weaken the cryptography methods contained within the app at the request of a third party, private or public.</strong> This also means no backdoors will ever be added. We would rather shut down the project than be forced to do this, which would betray the very essence of our efforts. If we learn that a counterfeit version is circulating, whether placed by hackers or government agencies, we will make the fact known to users.</p>
    <p>The app does store your user ID, options, and serials for any given website (not the generated password, and much less the Master Key), plus encrypted user-supplied passwords into Google servers so you can have them on different machines. These are all optional, and you don't have to supply them if this is a problem. In this case you may have to use the generator app included further up in this Help page, which does not sync with Google at all. This data is shared with nobody else, and in fact we don't have access to it, only Google and yourself do.</p>
    <p><strong>Notice:</strong> Since this program is distributed as a piece of human-readable code, we consider it an expression of free speech protected by the laws of many countries. Putting into circulation tampered versions of the app, whether by individuals or public entities, violates free speech and copyright protection laws.</p>
    <p>SynthPass contains strong cryptographic methods, which may be illegal to use in some countries. Please check the local laws before using it.</p>
