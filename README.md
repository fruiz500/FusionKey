# FusionKey-extension
Fusion of PassLok and SynthPass

This is where you find them in the respective app strores:
Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fusionkey/legnppmlegkibpinfjodjbejohblaaam
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fusionkey/

This is the full PassLok, not a reduced version like PassLok for Email, with all its functions. When you click the FusionKey icon with 
a page that is ready to add an ecrypted message or contains encrypted material, PassLok opens. If the page contains password inputs,
SynthPass opens instead.
